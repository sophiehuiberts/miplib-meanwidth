# miplib-meanwidth
Half the mean width of a polyhedron P equals the mean value of the LP max theta^T x subject to x in P, where the mean is taken over the uniformly random choice of theta from the unit sphere.

In this code we compute half the mean width for the LP relaxations of the MIPLIB 2017 benchmark set.
